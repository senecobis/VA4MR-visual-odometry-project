% first we have to find the keypoints of the two image and match it
% we will do so by using harris (o shi-tommasi) scores 
% than we do non maximum suppression and select the highest scores
% than we find keypoints for each image, the return should be 
% 2 x num_keypoints containing 2d coordinates of each keypoint for
% the considered image
