%% feature extraction
    % After detecting the corners we need to extract the descriptors in order to
    % do the matching, extractFeatures does that.
    % The type of descriptor returned depends on the type of points1. In this
    % case it is a cornerPoints so we get FREAK descriptors, fast to compute and
    % both rotation and scale invariant.

    % we could set upright to true since the images are not rotated in parking
    % but this way we can use it for all the datasets; NB: rotation in radiants

    [features1,valid_points1] = extractFeatures(I1,strongest1,'BlockSize',11);
%     valid_points1
    [features2,valid_points2] = extractFeatures(I2,strongest2,'BlockSize',11);
%     valid_points2
   
    %esclude i keypoints che stanno sul bordo quindi ne perdo un po
    % size(points1)
    % size(valid_points1)

    % valid points is a cornerPoints object containing for each feature the px
    % location, cornerness response and lastly the tot number of features
    % extracted.

    %features contains the descriptors as binaryFeatures objects

%% feature matching
    % We take the keypoint's descriptors and confront them one by one until we
    % have a match. The confront is made via SSD, which is also the default
    % setting, that's why it is not specified.

    % the matching ratio is set to 0.8 which is the optimal for SIFT 

    indexPairs = matchFeatures(features1,features2,'MaxRatio',0.6,'Unique',true,'MatchThreshold',10.0);
    matchedPoints1 = valid_points1(indexPairs(:,1),:);
    p1 = matchedPoints1.Location;
    p1_corn_points = cornerPoints(p1);
    matchedPoints2 = valid_points2(indexPairs(:,2),:);
    p2 = matchedPoints2.Location;
    p2_corn_points = cornerPoints(p2);

    % in matchedPoints we have 3 attributes:
    % location --> [num_matches x 2] = u,v for each match
    % metric   --> scalar index for match strength
    % count    --> num_matches

% if true

%     hold on
%     plot(p1_corn_points)
%     hold off

%     imshow(I2)
